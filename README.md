# LuddeToolset
`LuddeToolset` is a collection of methods and classes I started developing back in 2019. It is a product of several problems I came across whilst designing and building different applications in various fields.

This public archive acts both as a memory showcasing where I started my journey of professional development and a indicator of the various domains I've taken a interest in.
